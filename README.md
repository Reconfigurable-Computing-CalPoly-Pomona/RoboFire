**Implementation**

As seen in Figure 1 the finished product was compact and splash-proof with the only elements exposed being the camera,the fire sensor and the water reservoir with its respective components.

**Current project state and future plans**
The current state of the project is a working controllable vehicle that automatically sprays water upon fire detection. Plans for expansion include but are not limited to: the implementation of image processing software on the board to replace flame sensors, integrate the ability to control the motors using PWM, and ultimately, making the gorund vehicle fully autonomous.
