**Current project state and future plans**
The current state of the project is a working controllable vehicle that automatically sprays water upon fire detection. Plans for expansion include but are not limited to: the implementation of image processing software on the board to replace flame sensors, integrate the ability to control the motors using PWM, and ultimately, making the ground vehicle fully autonomous.
